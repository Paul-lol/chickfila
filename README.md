# chickfila
This is a test app to learn random stuff within a chick-fil-a ordering context. It will make sense when you go through the README lol


## Main Idea 
Use the chickfila ordering system to create a cli app, http endpoint some other interface that can work on the same shared data. Learn about synchronization and deadlocka and everything and think about how you would design it. You can share your idea with gemini. 

The goal of this app is to have a place to try new things out and implement them.
